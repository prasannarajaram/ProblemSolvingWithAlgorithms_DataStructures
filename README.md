# Algorithms and Data Structures
## Introduction
The exercises are from the book Problem Solving using Algorithms and Data Structures
by Brad Miller and David Ranum.

## Objective
The objective is to develop the habit of thinking in terms of DS when handling data and 
the same goes for algorithms as well. Write good working algorithms in the first place
and make some improvements around it.

## Comment
I will update this README file as I create each and every exercise.
